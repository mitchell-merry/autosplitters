# autosplitters
A collection of all of my autosplitters and load removers - tools for the speedrunning program LiveSplit.

## Other Autosplitters
Scripts I've worked on outside of this repo:
- **In Sound Mind:** https://github.com/ontrigger/ism-autosplitter
- **My Friendly Neighbourhood:** https://github.com/TheDementedSalad/My-Friendly-Neighborhood-Splitter/tree/main
- **The Blair Witch Volumes:** https://github.com/MildGothDaddy/Bw_asl
- **Trepang2:** https://github.com/LiterallyMetaphorical/Livesplit.Trepang2

I have worked on other autosplitters, those that are either
full LiveSplit components or use the Auto Splitting Runtime (ASR):
